# Introduction to Calculus


## Calculus deals with two problems
    - Rate of change
        - Examples
        - Moving objects
        - Bacteria in a dish from theory
        - Slope tangent lines
            - Normal lines
            - Luster
        - Something from economics
    - Cumulative effect of change
        - Examples
        - Moving objects
        - Bacteria in a dish from measures
        - Area - any two variables multiplied


## Zero and equality in Calculus/Analysis
    - Not quite the same as in Algebra
    - Based on "real world" measurements and comparisons


## Limits - the worst name in all of mathematics
    - Not like speed limit
    - Example of value after infinite iterations of some method of approximation
    - Optionally, if it is still confusing, just learn how to solve the problems, understanding comes from use.
        - Foot note - when will I use it?
            - Never which is sad
            - Try explaining the utility of counting to someone who cannot count. !?!!


## Differentials
    - Delta Î” vs $d$
    - According to ChatGPT: In calculus, the differential is the
        infinitesimal change or the derivative of a function. It
        represents the rate at which a function changes as its input
        (independent variable) changes. For a function $y = f(x)$,
        the differential $dy$ represents the change in the dependent
        variable $y$ for a small change in the independent variable
        $x$, and it is denoted as $dy = f'(x) dx$, where $f'(x)$ is the
        derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$.
